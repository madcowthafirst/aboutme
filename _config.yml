about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I'm a social person with a professional and pragmatic mentality. A technical challenge is what gets me going, grab the problem and take it to end to find a solution. A pleasant working environment and a personal touch are important to me.
  My hobbies are soccer, cars, movies, running and holidays to the USA.

  My current role revolves around automation for cloud based solutions. Working mainly with Terraform & Ansible provisioning WSO2 environments on AWS.

  In my previous role I was mainly working with IBM related technologies with a focus on IBM Connections.
  I also have a broad knowledge of other IBM WebSphere based products like: Sametime, WebSphere Portal, WebSphere Application Server and IBM MQ.
